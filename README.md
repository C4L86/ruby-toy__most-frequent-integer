## Find the most frequent integer

Given an array of integers (positive, negative, or 0), find the integer that occurs most
frequently in that array (you might remember this as the
*[mode](https://www.mathsisfun.com/definitions/mode.html)* from your middle school math class).
The set of numbers won't necessarily be in order. If there is more than one number that appears
most frequently, your algorithm should return `nil`.

Here are some examples:

+ `[1, 2, 1, 1,]` should return `1`
+ `[1, 2, 3, 4]` should return `nil`
+ `[1, 1, 2, 3, 3]` should return `nil`
